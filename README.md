# Shaad! – Code, Music, and Moving Pictures

Salams, This repo holds the systems, code, and raw files behind my YouTube Videos.

Here you will find:
- 🖼️ **Blender project files** – rigs, animations, simulations.  
- 🎶 **Music production resources** – stems, mixes, raw sessions.  
- 💻 **Creative coding experiments** – p5.js sketches, ASCII generators, glitch art.  
- 🎬 **Everything** that feeds my YouTube music videos.

### 🔗 Watch the Art
I create music videos that mix **animation, code, and narrative**.

One of my works: [**"Feeling Like a Pen"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psyI626RARY)  
A visual story where ink becomes alive.

## 📜 Philosophy
> *"Every work costs a backbone. What you create is what keeps you alive."*  

I believe what you make outlasts you.  
Code, music, and bones – they all write your story.
